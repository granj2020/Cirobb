# Cirobb-Engine 1.1.4

Cirobb Engine is a 2d physics engine inspired by box2d lite that was created with the purpose of helping people who are starting
in this wonderful world of physics for video games. The engine uses the erin catto contact persistence algorithm
and its implementation of the PGS (Projected Gauss Seidel) solver to solve the MLCP very well known as a sequential impulse.
The main idea of ​​this project is to explain in more detail how physics engines work,
I must clarify that not all physics engines use the same approach. This engine follows the dynamics of impulses.


If you want to make more complex simulations with many Constraints and Shapes. 
I recommend you use better box2d which in my opinion I think it's the best 2d open source physics engine that exists.




If you want to better understand how the Physics Engine I recommend you learn a lot about linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis,
Calculus and Classical Physics. And I Also recommend you these slides and books:
