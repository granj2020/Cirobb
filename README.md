# Cirobb V1.1.4

" Tested in Visual Studio 2012"

<b>Cirobb</b> is a <b>2d Physics Engine</b> inspired by box2d lite that was created with the purpose of helping people who are starting
in this wonderful world of physics for Videogames. The Engine uses the Erin Catto contact persistence algorithm
and it's implementation of the <b>PGS</b> (Projected Gauss Seidel) solver to solve the MLCP very well known as a <b>SI</b> (Sequential Impulse).
The main idea of this project is to explain in more detail how physics engines work,
I must clarify that not all physics engines use the same approach. This engine follows the dynamics of impulses.



If you want to make more complex simulations with many Constraints and Shapes. 
I recommend you use better <b>Box2D</b> which in my opinion I think it's the best 2D open source physics engine that exists.
