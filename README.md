# Cirobb-Engine

Cirobb Engine is a 2d physics engine inspired by box2d lite that was created with the purpose of helping people who are starting
in this wonderful world of physics for video games. The engine uses the erin catto contact persistence algorithm
and its implementation of the PGS (Projected Gauss Seidel) solver to solve the MLCP very well known as a sequential impulse.
The main idea of ​​this project is to explain in more detail how physics engines work,
I must clarify that not all physics engines use the same approach. This engine follows the dynamics of impulses.



/////////////////////// Description of Explanation ///////////////////////

* Not all headers are going to be explained. Only the most important and relevant.

* I will not go into such deep details.

Hello, my name is Jonathan Gustavo Peña Rincones, I am from Venezuela and I am 20 years old and I really like physics in games,
I like the dynamics of physics engines and how the equations predict movement. You can contact me here: granj215@gmail.com.
